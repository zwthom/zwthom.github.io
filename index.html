                Hello! My name is Zackery Thom. I am currently a student at the University of South Carolina studying Computer Science. I enjoy learning about new things and learning new programming languages. My goal is to graduate college and get a well-paying job so I can be well off and visit different places around the world.

                The sketches show how the app would run, so it would have a bicycle icons for all of the bike racks, and if you click on it it would show where all of the racks are, and you can search for different bike racks.
